npm (Node Package Manager) is a tool that comes with Node.js and allows you to easily manage and install packages (libraries and modules) for your JavaScript projects. 
It acts as a central repository where developers can publish and share their code with others.
In simpler terms, think of npm as a huge online store for JavaScript code. 

When you need a particular functionality in your project, instead of writing it from scratch, you can search for a package on npm that already provides that functionality. 
You can then install that package in your project with a simple command.
npm helps you avoid reinventing the wheel by providing access to a wide range of ready-to-use code that other developers have created and shared. 
These packages can help you add features, solve common problems, and speed up your development process.

To use npm, you typically initialize your project by creating a `package.json` file that lists the dependencies (packages) your project requires. 
You can then run `npm install` to automatically download and install all the required packages. 
npm takes care of fetching the packages from the registry, resolving dependencies, and setting up the project to use those packages.

In addition to managing packages, npm also provides other features like publishing your own packages, updating packages, and running scripts defined in the `package.json` file.
Overall, npm simplifies the process of finding, installing, and managing JavaScript packages, saving you time and effort while building your projects.
It promotes code reuse and collaboration within the JavaScript community, making it easier for developers to share and benefit from each other's work.

At the end of day : package, dependencies, modules they all mean the same thing.
There is no quality control on NPM. Anyone can publish anything. So, it's your job to sniff out useless and useful modules.

You can install packages as local dependency and global dependency.
Local - You can use it only within the project.
Global - You can use it in any project.
