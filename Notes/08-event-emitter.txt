In Node.js, event emitters are a core feature that allows objects to emit and listen for events. 
Here's a simplified explanation:

1. An event emitter in Node.js is like a radio station broadcasting events.

2. Any part of your code can subscribe to these events by registering itself as a listener.

3. When an event occurs, the event emitter broadcasts it to all the subscribed listeners.

4. Each listener can perform specific actions or respond to the event in its own way.

5. This mechanism enables different parts of your Node.js application to communicate and coordinate with each other by emitting and listening for events.

Overall, event emitters provide a flexible and efficient way to implement event-driven programming in Node.js, 
allowing for decoupled and modular code that can easily respond to and handle various events within your application.
